# Specify the parser to use
# For Java, Prettier usually relies on external plugins or is run on generated files.
# For files like JSON, XML, Markdown, etc., default parsers are often sufficient.
# For .toml, it's typically parsed as TOML.
# parser = "toml" # This might be inferred or handled by a plugin if available

# Ensure newline at the end of file
